# AutofacCloudFoundry - ASP.NET 4.x Sample Application 
ASP.NET 4.x sample app built using the Autofac IOC container and illustrating how to use [Config Server for Pivotal Cloud Foundry](http://docs.pivotal.io/spring-cloud-services/config-server/) as a configuration source.

# Pre-requisites
1. Installed Pivotal CloudFoundry with Windows support
2. Installed Spring Cloud Services 
3. Visual Studio 2017

# Setup Config Server
You must first create an instance of the Config Server service in a org/space.

1. cf target -o myorg -s development
2. cd src\AspDotNet4\AutofacCloudFoundry
3. cf create-service p-config-server standard myConfigServer -c ./config-server.json
4. Wait for service to be available. (e.g. cf services)

# Publish App & Push

1. Open src\AspDotNet4\Configuration.sln in Visual Studio.
2. Select AutofacCloudFoundry project in Solution Explorer.
3. Right-click and select Publish
4. Publish the App to a folder. (e.g. c:\publish)
5. cd publish_folder (e.g. cd c:\publish)
6. cf push 

# What to expect
The cf push will create an app in the space by the name `foo` and will bind the `myConfigServer` service instance to the app. You can hit the app @ `http://foo.x.y.z/`.

The Config Servers Git repository has been set to: `https://github.com/spring-cloud-samples/config-repo`

Use the menus at the top of the app to see various output:

* `CloudFoundry Settings` - should show `VCAP_APPLICATION` and `VCAP_SERVICES` configuration data.
* `Config Server Settings` - should show the settings used by the client when communicating to the config server.  These have been picked up from the service binding.
* `Config Server Data` - this is the configuration data returned from the Config Servers Git Repo. It will be some of the data from `foo.properties`, `foo-development.properties` and `application.yml` found in the Git repo.
* `Reload` - will cause a reload of the configuration data from the server.

# Observe Logs
To see the logs as you startup and use the app: `cf logs foo`

You should see something like this during startup:
