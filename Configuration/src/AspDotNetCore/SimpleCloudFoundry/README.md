# SimpleCloudFoundry - ASP.NET Core Sample Application 
ASP.NET Core sample app illustrating how to use [Config Server for Pivotal Cloud Foundry](http://docs.pivotal.io/spring-cloud-services/config-server/) as a configuration source.

# Pre-requisites

1. Installed Pivotal CloudFoundry 1.10+
2. Installed Spring Cloud Services 1.1+
3. .NET Core SDK 2.0

# Setup Config Server
You must first create an instance of the Config Server service in a org/space.

1. cf target -o myorg -s development
2. cd src/AspDotNetCore/SimpleCloudFoundry
3. cf create-service p-config-server standard myConfigServer -c ./config-server.json
4. Wait for service to become ready (i.e. cf services )

# Publish App & Push

1. cf target -o myorg -s development
2. cd src/AspDotNetCore/SimpleCloudFoundry
3. dotnet restore --configfile nuget.config
4. Publish app to a directory selecting the framework and runtime you want to run on. 
(e.g. `dotnet publish  -f netcoreapp2.0 -r ubuntu.14.04-x64`)
5. Push the app using the appropriate manifest.
 (e.g. `cf push -f manifest.yml -p bin/Debug/netcoreapp2.0/ubuntu.14.04-x64/publish` or `cf push -f manifest-windows.yml -p bin/Debug/netcoreapp2.0/win10-x64/publish`) 


Note: If you are using self-signed certificates it is possible that you might run into SSL certificate validation issues when pushing this app. The simplest way to fix this:

1. Disable certificate validation for the Spring Cloud Config Client.  You can do this by editing `appsettings.json` and add `spring:cloud:config:validate_certificates=false`.

# What to expect
The cf push will create an app in the space by the name `foo` and will bind the `myConfigServer` service instance to the app. You can hit the app @ `http://foo.x.y.z/`.

The Config Servers Git repository has been set to: `https://github.com/spring-cloud-samples/config-repo`

Use the menus at the top of the app to see various output:

* `CloudFoundry Settings` - should show `VCAP_APPLICATION` and `VCAP_SERVICES` configuration data.
* `Config Server Settings` - should show the settings used by the client when communicating to the config server.  These have been picked up from the service binding.
* `Config Server Data` - this is the configuration data returned from the Config Servers Git Repo. It will be some of the data from `foo.properties`, `foo-development.properties` and `application.yml` found in the Git repo.
* `Reload` - will cause a reload of the configuration data from the server.

# Observe Logs
To see the logs as you startup and use the app: `cf logs foo`

On a Linux cell, you should see something like this during startup:
