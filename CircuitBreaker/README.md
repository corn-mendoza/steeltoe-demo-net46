# Steeltoe Circuit Breaker Sample Applications
This repo tree contains sample apps illustrating how to use the Steeltoe [CircuitBreaker](https://github.com/SteeltoeOSS/CircuitBreaker) packages. 
* src/AspDotNetCore/Fortune-Teller/Fortune-Teller-Service - ASP.NET Core microservice illustrating how to use [Spring Cloud Eureka Server](http://projects.spring.io/spring-cloud/docs/1.0.3/spring-cloud.html#spring-cloud-eureka-server) for service registration.
* src/AspDotNetCore/Fortune-Teller/Fortune-Teller-UI - ASP.NET Core MVC app illustrating how to use [Spring Cloud Eureka Server](http://projects.spring.io/spring-cloud/docs/1.0.3/spring-cloud.html#spring-cloud-eureka-server) for service discovery and [Spring Cloud Hystrix](http://cloud.spring.io/spring-cloud-static/Dalston.SR1/#_circuit_breaker_hystrix_clients) commands for accessing the Fortune Service.  The application also illustrates how to use the Hystrix dashboard, both on Cloud Foundry and locally, for monitoring the status of Hystrix commands.
