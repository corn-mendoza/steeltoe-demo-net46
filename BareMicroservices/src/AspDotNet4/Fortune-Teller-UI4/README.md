# Fortune-Teller-UI - ASP.NET 4 MVC Application
ASP.NET 4 MVC sample app illustrating how to use [Spring Cloud Eureka Server](http://projects.spring.io/spring-cloud/docs/1.0.3/spring-cloud.html#spring-cloud-eureka-server) for discovering micro services. The Fortune-Teller-UI attempts to locate the fortuneService in the Eureka server and uses it to get your fortune.

Note: This application is built using the Autofac IOC container.
# Pre-requisites - Running Local

This sample assumes that there is a running Spring Cloud Eureka Server on your machine. To make this happen:

1. Install Java 8 JDK.
2. Install Maven 3.x.
3. Clone the Spring Cloud Samples Eureka repository. (https://github.com/spring-cloud-samples/eureka.git)
4. Go to the eureka server directory (`eureka`) and fire it up with `mvn spring-boot:run`
5. This sample will default to looking for its eurka server on http://localhost:8761/eureka, so it should all connect.

# Building & Running - Local

1. Clone this repo. (i.e. git clone https://github.com/SteeltoeOSS/Samples)
2. Startup Visual Studio 2015
3. Open samples/Discovery/Discovery.sln
4. Select AspDotNet4/Fortune-Teller-UI4 and build it
5. Select AspDotNet4/Fortune-Teller-UI4 as the Startup project.
6. Ctrl+F5 or F5

At this point the Fortune Teller UI is up and running and ready for displaying your fortune. Hit http://localhost:5555/ to see it!  Of course you have to have the FortuneService up and running first!

# Pre-requisites - Running on CloudFoundry

1. Installed Pivotal CloudFoundry 1.7+ with Greenhouse (i.e. Windows cell)
2. Installed Spring Cloud Services 1.0.9+
3. Web tools installed and on PATH, (e.g. npm, gulp, etc).  
Note: If you're on Windows and you have VS2015 Update 3, you can add these to your path: C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio 14.0\Web\External.

# Setup Service Registry on CloudFoundry
You must first create an instance of the Service Registry service in a org/space.

1. cf target -o myorg -s development
2. cf create-service p-service-registry standard myDiscoveryService 

# Publish App & Push to CloudFoundry

1. Open Samples\Discovery\Discovery.sln in Visual Studio 2015.
2. Select Fortune-Teller-UI4 project in Solution Explorer.
3. Right-click and select Publish
4. Publish the App to a folder. (e.g. c:\publish)
5. cd publish_folder (e.g. cd c:\publish)
6. cf push 

Windows Note: If you are using self-signed certificates you are likely to run into SSL certificate validation issues when pushing this app. You have two choices to fix this:

1. If you have created your own ROOT CA and from it created a certificate that you have installed in HAProxy/Ext LB, then you can install the ROOT CA on the windows cells and you would be good to go.
2. Disable certificate validation for the Spring Cloud Discovery Client.  You can do this by editing `appsettings.json` and add `eureka:client:validate_certificates=false`.

# What to expect - CloudFoundry
After building and running the app, you should see something like the following in the logs. 

To see the logs as you startup and use the app: `cf logs fortuneui`

You should see something like this during startup:
