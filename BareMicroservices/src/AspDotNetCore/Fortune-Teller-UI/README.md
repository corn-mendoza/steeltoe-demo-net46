# Fortune-Teller-UI - ASP.NET Core MVC Application
ASP.NET Core sample app illustrating how to use [Spring Cloud Eureka Server](http://projects.spring.io/spring-cloud/docs/1.0.3/spring-cloud.html#spring-cloud-eureka-server) for discovering micro services. The Fortune-Teller-UI attempts to locate the fortuneService in the Eureka server and uses it to get your fortune.

# Pre-requisites - Local

This sample assumes that there is a running Spring Cloud Eureka Server on your machine. To make this happen:

1. Install Java 8 JDK.
2. Install Maven 3.x.
3. Clone the Spring Cloud Samples Eureka repository. (https://github.com/spring-cloud-samples/eureka.git)
4. Go to the eureka server directory (`eureka`) and fire it up with `mvn spring-boot:run`
5. This sample will default to looking for its eurka server on http://localhost:8761/eureka, so it should all connect.
6. Install .NET Core SDK

# Building & Running - Local

1. Clone this repo. (i.e. git clone https://github.com/SteeltoeOSS/Samples)
2. cd samples/Discovery/src/AspDotNetCore/Fortune-Teller-UI
3. dotnet restore --configfile nuget.config
4. dotnet run -f netcoreapp2.0 --server.urls http://*:5555


# What to expect - Local
After building and running the app, you should see something like the following:
```
$ cd samples/Discovery/src/AspDotNetCore/Fortune-Teller-UI
$ dotnet run -f netcoreapp2.0 --server.urls http://*:5555
Hosting environment: Production
Now listening on: http://*:5555
Application started. Press Ctrl+C to shut down.
```
At this point the Fortune Teller UI is up and running and ready for displaying your fortune. Hit http://localhost:5555/ to see it!

# Pre-requisites - CloudFoundry

1. Installed Pivotal CloudFoundry
2. Optionally install Windows support 
3. Installed Spring Cloud Services 
4. Install .NET Core SDK

# Setup Service Registry on CloudFoundry
You must first create an instance of the Service Registry service in a org/space.

1. cf target -o myorg -s development
2. cf create-service p-service-registry standard myDiscoveryService 
3. Wait for the service to become ready! (i.e. cf services)

# Publish App & Push to CloudFoundry

1. cf target -o myorg -s development
2. cd samples/Discovery/src/AspDotNetCore/Fortune-Teller-UI
3. dotnet restore --configfile nuget.config
4. Publish app to a directory selecting the framework and runtime you want to run on. 
(e.g. `dotnet publish  -f netcoreapp2.0 -r ubuntu.14.04-x64`)
5. Push the app using the appropriate manifest.
 (e.g. `cf push -f manifest.yml -p bin/Debug/netcoreapp2.0/ubuntu.14.04-x64/publish` or `cf push -f manifest-windows.yml -p bin/Debug/netcoreapp2.0/win10-x64/publish`)


Note: If you are using self-signed certificates it is possible that you might run into SSL certificate validation issues when pushing this app. The simplest way to fix this:

1. Disable certificate validation for the Spring Cloud Discovery Client.  You can do this by editing `appsettings.json` and add `eureka:client:validate_certificates=false`.

# What to expect - CloudFoundry
After building and running the app, you should see something like the following in the logs. 

To see the logs as you startup and use the app: `cf logs fortuneui`

On a Windows cell, you should see something like this during startup:

# Enabling SSL usage on Cloud Foundry

If you wish to use SSL communications between the Fortune Teller UI and the Fortune Teller Service, have a look at the comments in the files listed below.  You will need to make modifications to one or more of those files. Also, you are encouraged to read the [Cloud Foundry documentation](https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/1-10/adminguide/securing-traffic.html) on how SSL is configured, used and implemented before trying to use it with the Fortune Teller app.

1. `FortuneService.cs` - Changes needed to enable SSL usage when the Fortune Teller Service (i.e. Kestrel) is presenting Self-Signed certificates to the client.
