# CloudFoundry Single Signon Security Sample App 

ASP.NET Core sample app illustrating how to make use of the Steeltoe [CloudFoundry External Security Provider](https://github.com/SteeltoeOSS/Security) for Authentication and Authorization against a CloudFoundry OAuth2 security service (e.g. [UAA Server](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/uaa) or [Pivotal Single Signon Service](https://docs.pivotal.io/p-identity/)).

# Pre-requisites - CloudFoundry

1. Install Pivotal Cloud Foundry
2. Optionally, installed Windows support on Cloud Foundry
3. Install .NET Core SDK
4. Optionally, Single Signon for CloudFoundry if you wish use it as your OAuth Security server.

# Create OAuth2 Service Instance on CloudFoundry

You must first create an instance of a OAuth2 service in a org/space. As mentioned above there are a couple to choose from. You can directly use the CloudFoundry [UAA Server](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/uaa) or you can use the [Pivotal Single Signon Service](https://docs.pivotal.io/p-identity/). In the steps that follow we will directly use the [UAA Server](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/uaa) as an OAuth2 service.

If instead, you want to use the [Pivotal SSO Service](https://docs.pivotal.io/p-identity/1-8/getting-started.html), follow the installation and configuration instructions [here](https://docs.pivotal.io/p-identity/installation.html). Note that you will still need to add a User and Group `testgroup` as mentioned below to the SSO Internal Store.  But the process you use to do this is different when using the SSO tile, so you should follow [Add Users to SSO Internal User Store](http://docs.pivotal.io/p-identity/configure-id-providers.html#add-to-int) to accomplish this. Also, when you create your OAuth service instance you should name it `myOAuthService` as the provided `manifest-*.yml` files will bind the pushed apps to that service instance name.

### Using UAA Server - Install UAA Command Line

Before creating the OAuth2 service instance, we first need to use the UAA command line tool to establish some security credentials for our sample app. To install the UAA command line tool and target it to your UAA server:

1. Install Ruby if you don't already have it.
2. gem install cf-uaac
3. uaac target uaa.`YOUR-CLOUDFOUNDRY-SYSTEM-DOMAIN` (e.g. `uaac target uaa.system.testcloud.com`)

### Using UAA Server - Obtain Admin Client Access Token

Next we need to authenticate and obtain an access token for the `admin client` from the UAA server so that we can add our new application/user credentials. You will need the `Admin Client Secret` for your installation of CloudFoundry in order to accomplish this. If you are using Pivotal CloudFoundry (PCF), you can obtain this from the `Ops Manager/Elastic Runtime` credentials page under the `UAA` section.  Look for `Admin Client Credentials` and then use it as follows:

1. uaac token client get admin -s `ADMIN_CLIENT_SECRET`
2. uaac contexts

### Using UAA Server - Add User and Group

Next we will add a new `user` and `group` to the UAA Server database. Do NOT change the groupname: `testgroup` as that is used for policy based authorization in the sample application. Of course you can change the username and password to anything you would like.

1. uaac group add testgroup
2. uaac user add dave --given_name Dave --family_name Tillman --emails dave@testcloud.com --password Password1!
3. uaac member add testgroup dave 

### Using UAA Server - Add New Client for our App

Once complete we are ready to add our application as a new client to the UAA server. This will establish our applications credentials and enable it to interact with the UAA server. To do this you can use the line below, but you must replace the `YOUR-CLOUDFOUNDRY-APP-DOMAIN` with your setups domain.

1. uaac client add myTestApp --scope cloud_controller.read,cloud_controller_service_permissions.read,openid,testgroup --authorized_grant_types authorization_code,refresh_token --authorities uaa.resource --redirect_uri http://single-signon.`YOUR-CLOUDFOUNDRY-APP-DOMAIN`/signin-cloudfoundry --autoapprove cloud_controller.read,cloud_controller_service_permissions.read,openid,testgroup --secret myTestApp
 
### Using UAA Server - Add CUPs based OAuth Service

Last, we create a CUPS service providing the appropriate UAA server configuration data. You can use the provided `credentials.json` file when creating your CUPS service, but you will FIRST need to edit it and replace the `YOUR-CLOUDFOUNDRY-SYSTEM-DOMAIN` with your setups domain. Once done you can do the following:

```
cf target -o myorg -s development
cf cups myOAuthService -p "{\"client_id\": \"myTestApp\",\"client_secret\": \"myTestApp\",\"uri\": \"uaa://login.system.testcloud.com\"}"
```

# Publish App & Push to CloudFoundry

1. cf target -o myorg -s development
2. cd samples/Security/src/CloudFoundrySingleSignon
3. dotnet restore --configfile nuget.config
4. Publish app to a directory selecting the framework and runtime you want to run on. 
(e.g. `dotnet publish  -f netcoreapp2.0 -r ubuntu.14.04-x64`)
5. Push the app using the appropriate manifest.
 (e.g. `cf push -f manifest.yml -p bin/Debug/netcoreapp2.0/ubuntu.14.04-x64/publish` or `cf push -f manifest-windows.yml -p bin/Debug/netcoreapp2.0/win10-x64/publish`)


Note: The provided manifest(s) will create an app named `single-signon` and attempt to bind it to the CUPS service `myOAuthService`.

# What to expect - CloudFoundry
After building and running the app, you should see something like the following in the logs. 

To see the logs as you startup and use the app: `cf logs single-signon`

On a Windows cell, you should see something like this during startup:
```
2016-08-05T07:23:02.15-0600 [CELL/0]     OUT Creating container
2016-08-05T07:23:03.81-0600 [CELL/0]     OUT Successfully created container
2016-08-05T07:23:09.07-0600 [APP/0]      OUT Running cmd /c .\CloudFoundrySingleSignon --server.urls http://*:%PORT%
2016-08-05T07:23:14.68-0600 [APP/0]      OUT Hosting environment: development
2016-08-05T07:23:14.68-0600 [APP/0]      OUT Content root path: C:\containerizer\75E10B9301D2D9B4A8\user\app
2016-08-05T07:23:14.68-0600 [APP/0]      OUT Application started. Press Ctrl+C to shut down.
2016-08-05T07:23:14.68-0600 [APP/0]      OUT Now listening on: http://*:51217
```
At this point the app is up and running.  You can access it at http://single-signon.`YOUR-CLOUDFOUNDRY-APP-DOMAIN`/.

On the apps menu, click on the `Log in` menu item and you should be redirected to the CloudFoundry login page. Enter `dave` and `Password1!`, or whatever name/password you used above,  and you should be authenticated and redirected back to the single-signon home page.

Note: If you are using the [Pivotal Single Signon](https://docs.pivotal.io/p-identity/) tile, you will notice an error when you attempt to login. You will see something like: `Invalid redirect http://single-signon.apps.testcloud.com/signin-cloudfoundry did not match one of the registered values`. 
This is due to the fact the `redirect_uri` is not fully configured for the `single-signon` app.  To fully configure the app, copy the URI from the error message and save it. Then, open up the `Apps Manager` and select the `myOAuthService` Single Sign-on Service and then click on the `Manage` link.  In the manager page, under `Apps`, select the `single-signon` app and add the URI from the error message to the `Auth Redirect URIs` setting.  Remember to save your settings.

Two of the endpoints in the `HomeController` have Authorization policys applied:
```
[Authorize(Policy = "testgroup")]
public IActionResult About()
{
    ViewData["Message"] = "Your application description page.";

    return View();
}


[Authorize(Policy = "testgroup1")]
public IActionResult Contact()
{
    ViewData["Message"] = "Your contact page.";

    return View();
}
```
If you try and access the `About` menu item you should see the `About` page as user `dave` is a member of that group and is authorized to access the end point.

If you try and access the `Contact` menu item you should see `Access Denied, Insufficent permissions` as `dave` is not a member of the `testgroup1` and therefore can not access the end point.

If you access the `InvokeJwtSample` menu item, you will find the app will attempt to invoke a secured endpoint in a second Security sample app [CloudFoundryJwtAuthentication](https://github.com/SteeltoeOSS/Samples/tree/dev/Security/src/CloudFoundryJwtAuthentication). In order for this to be functional you must first push the [CloudFoundryJwtAuthentication](https://github.com/SteeltoeOSS/Samples/tree/dev/Security/src/CloudFoundryJwtAuthentication) sample using the Readme instructions you can find [here](https://github.com/SteeltoeOSS/Samples/tree/dev/Security/src/CloudFoundryJwtAuthentication).

Once you have [CloudFoundryJwtAuthentication](https://github.com/SteeltoeOSS/Samples/tree/dev/Security/src/CloudFoundryJwtAuthentication) up and running, then if you access the `InvokeJwtSample` menu item when you are logged in, you should see some `values` returned from the [CloudFoundryJwtAuthentication](https://github.com/SteeltoeOSS/Samples/tree/dev/Security/src/CloudFoundryJwtAuthentication) app.  If you are logged out, then you will see a `401 (Unauthorized)` message.
