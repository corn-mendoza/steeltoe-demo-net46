# Rabbit Connector Sample App - RabbitConnection

ASP.NET Core sample app illustrating how to use [Steeltoe Rabbit Connector](https://github.com/SteeltoeOSS/Connectors/tree/master/src/Steeltoe.CloudFoundry.Connector.Rabbit) for connecting to a Rabbit service on CloudFoundry. This specific sample illustrates how to use a `RabbitMQ.Client` to send and receive messages on the bound rabbitmq service.

# Pre-requisites - CloudFoundry

1. Installed Pivotal CloudFoundry 1.7+
2. Optionaly, installed Windows support (Greenhouse) 
3. Installed Rabbit CloudFoundry service
4. Install .NET Core SDK

# Create Rabbit Service Instance on CloudFoundry
You must first create an instance of the Rabbit service in a org/space.

1. cf target -o myorg -s development
2. cf create-service p-rabbitmq standard myRabbitService 

# Publish App & Push to CloudFoundry

1. cf target -o myorg -s development
2. cd samples/Connectors/src/AspDotNetCore/Rabbit
3. dotnet restore --configfile nuget.config
4. Publish app to a directory selecting the framework and runtime you want to run on. 
(e.g. `dotnet publish  -f netcoreapp2.0 -r ubuntu.14.04-x64`)
5. Push the app using the appropriate manifest.
 (e.g. `cf push -f manifest.yml -p bin/Debug/netcoreapp2.0/ubuntu.14.04-x64/publish` or `cf push -f manifest-windows.yml -p bin/Debug/netcoreapp2.0/win10-x64/publish`)


Note: The provided manifest will create an app named `rabbit` and attempt to bind to the the app to Rabbit service `myRabbitService`.

# What to expect - CloudFoundry

After building and running the app, you should see something like the following in the logs. 

To see the logs as you startup and use the app: `cf logs rabbit`

On a Linux cell, you should see something like this during startup:
```

```
At this point the app is up and running. To send a message click "Send" and send a message over rabbit. Having sent a message, click "Receive" and you will start seeing those messages.
